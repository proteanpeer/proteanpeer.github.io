      <h1>Community</h1>
      <p>Since 2020, I've worked with my neighbors in Washington, DC's Ward 8 to organize events, advocate for investment, and build the kind of community we all want to live in.</p>

      <h2 id="overview-heading">Why Ward 8</h2>
      <p>Ward 8 is a historically underserved community east of the Anacostia River. It's also my home. The organizing work I've been part of here has deepened my understanding of how to listen to diverse stakeholders, confront harmful biases, center the needs of the most vulnerable, and build coalitions that produce real results. This work has shaped my approach to professional communications, community engagement, and leadership.</p>

        <h3>Oxon Run Neighborhood Cleanup &amp; Forest Restoration</h3>
        <p class="story-source">Featured in DCist</p>
        <p>What started as organizing regular trash pickups through a neighborhood Facebook group grew into a partnership with the Ward 8 Woods Conservancy to mobilize neighbors to clear more than 2,000 pounds of trash from the forest behind our homes. The cleanups became a catalyst for building relationships across the neighborhood and demonstrating what residents could accomplish together with minimal institutional support.</p>

        <h3>Annual Juneteenth Block Party</h3>
        <p class="story-source">Featured on ABC 7 News</p>
        <p>Working closely with a group of neighbors, I helped organize a block party in conjunction with the forest cleanup on Juneteenth. I coordinated support from neighbors and local elected leaders and assisted with event planning and media outreach. Donations from neighbors and the generosity of local business owners contributed to a day of family-friendly celebration — ice cream, a DJ, Zumba classes, a photo booth, tie-dye, and fireworks. The block party has become an annual tradition, and I've continued to co-lead planning efforts each year.</p>

        <h3>Ward 8 Dog Park Campaign</h3>
        <p class="story-source">Featured in The Washington Post, DCist, Yahoo! News, The Grio, Black Media Daily, and Congress Heights on the Rise</p>
        <p>After publishing a blog post about the absence of any public dog park in Ward 8, I became a spokesperson for the effort to petition DC's Department of Parks and Recreation to change that. Working closely with Black neighbors and local Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, I've connected with hundreds of Ward 8 residents, built a campaign website at OxonRunDogPark.org, and helped center the effort on the needs of the Black community and the broader context of equitable investment east of the Anacostia River.</p>

        <h3>Stargazing Events in Oxon Run Park</h3>
        <p>After sharing my own telescope with neighbors and connecting with Friends of Oxon Run through the cleanup and dog park work, I helped organize a public stargazing event to make astronomy — an otherwise expensive hobby — more accessible to Ward 8 residents. I'm now working with Friends of Oxon Run and the National Capital Astronomers to organize additional events east of the river.</p>

      <h2 id="approach-heading">My Approach to Community Work</h2>
      <p>Community organizing has taught me that sustainable change comes from listening first, building trust, and creating structures that empower people to lead — not from swooping in with solutions. Every event, campaign, and conversation I've been part of has reinforced this: the best outcomes happen when the people most affected by a problem are at the center of solving it. I bring this same philosophy to my professional work in marketing, communications, and engagement.</p>
